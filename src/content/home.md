## Our Programs

Colville Valley Animal Sanctuary offers many different programs and services for our community. We strive to help Stevens County residents with animal welfare. Our programs are meant to help people with companion animals keep their pets healthy and happy. We also offer community and education programs. 

### LOW COST VACCINATIONS & MICROCHIPPING

Once a month (March - November), CVAS hosts a low cost vaccination and microchipping service. Click below for all the details and dates so you can keep your pet healthy and safe!

### BARN CAT PROGRAM / TNR PROGRAM

Our Barn Cat Program helps place two or more, often feral, cats in a working environment! You can help change a catâ€™s life by giving her something to do, a warm home to come back to, and plenty of space to explore. 

The Trap-Neuter/Spay-ReHome program is meant for cats who are living in large communities. If you notice a colony of cats near you, take the appropriate action and get them altered to stop the production cycle.

### FOSTER A PET

Fostering a pet is a rewarding experience for our gracious and loving foster families that participate in our program. We are always in need of people who are looking to foster litters of kittens, senior cats, and more pets in unique circumstances!
