  title: "TNR Program (Trap-Neuter/Spay-Rehome or Return)"
  description: |
    TNR is a way to break the cycle of continuously breeding unwanted "community" cats. The cats are humanely trapped, taken to a clinic for spay/neuter, and given needed medical treatment. They are then found appropriate homes or taken back to their original home base.
  services: |
    CVAS provides the community traps and information on humane trapping strategies for cats that may be seeking shelter near you. Please help get these animals spayed/neutered! You can help your community by breaking the cycle of breeding and animal homelessness.
  availability: |
    We are not a public spay/neuter clinic but if we have available spaces with our outside vet services we can offer TNR/Spay+Neuter services. Please call to check for any current availability.

  description: |
    Depending on the situation, many TNR cases become Barn Cats, as they are feral animals. The CVAS Barn Cat Program matches shy cats that may not make good house pets with safe homes where their superior pest control talents will be appreciated! With barn cats on patrol, you can keep rodents under control without poisons or traps, while providing a home to a deserving animal. Barn cats need the same essentials as a house cat, but they enjoy working more than cuddling!
