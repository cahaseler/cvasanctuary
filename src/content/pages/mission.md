**The Colville Valley Animal Sanctuary is an animal shelter located in rural Stevens County of northeast Washington State.**

The Colville Valley Animal Sanctuary is determined by our mission to inspire the public to support the humane treatment of animals and to transform the lives of companion animals in need.

Our vision is to be part of a network of eastern Washington communities where:

- local government provides leadership and funding for humane society services
- every child is educated about the humane treatment of animals and the importance of spaying and neutering pets
- all residents look out for the well-being of all domestic animals as a matter of course
- abuse and neglect of animals is rare
- homeless and feral cats and dogs are rare

Founded in 2002 as Colville Pet Refuge, our mission is to improve the quality of life for both pets and people by providing humane society services. This includes shelter and rescue for pets in need, facilitating spay/neuter, and providing pet adoption services and affordable routine pet care such as vaccinations and microchipping.

Because there are no county or municipal shelters serving both cats and dogs in Stevens County, CVAS is called upon to provide a broad range of animal welfare services over a geographic area encompassing thousands of square miles.

Facilities and services for cats and cat owners are particularly lacking in Washington's northeastern corner. Whereas stray dogs may be picked up by municipal "animal control" and held for their owners or put up for adoption, cats in the same situation are left to fend for themselves, though they are just as much victims of illegal abandonment and neglect, or simply lost and in need of temporary safe harbor.

CVAS began as an all-volunteer organization in 2002, and continues to operate solely on the generosity and community spirit of its donors and volunteers.
