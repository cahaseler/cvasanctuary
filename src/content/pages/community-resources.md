  petRehoming:
    title: Pet Re-homing
    paragraphs:
      - "When a pet comes into your life, you never expect to give them to another home. Sometimes unpredictable circumstances makes re-homing a pet our only option. Because the bond between family and pet is strong, we want to find a way that your pet can stay with you."
      - "Many people re-home an animal because they move, they're deployed for service, their animal displays behavioral issues, or their child develops pet allergies. These are common circumstances for families, and there are ways to work with community resources and your pet to keep your bond long-lasting."
      - "Moving: Check with your landlord about their pet policies. Offer a pet deposit and negotiate higher rent in exchange for keeping your pet. If that isn't possible, check with family and friends to see if anyone can watch your pet while you search for pet-friendly housing. For military service, find a temporary foster home and check organizations that help military families with pets."
      - "Pet Allergies or Behavioral Issues: Work with your veterinarian and consider consulting behavioral specialists. Many issues can be resolved with proper training and medical care."
      - "If re-homing is your only option: CVAS may be able to help. When we have space we can adopt your pet out, but must give priority to strays. You can get creative and post an ad on the local pages; Facebook has multiple classified pages, including animal lost and found/rehoming for specifically this purpose. The more effort you put into the ad the better. Include photos and describe your pets most desirable qualities. (If your dog loves fetch, take a picture of him playing when he's happy.) Print off flyers to post at local bulletin boards, and utilize online adoption sites such as PetFinder."
