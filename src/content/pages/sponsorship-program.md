In order to provide adequate care for these animals, we depend entirely on the goodwill of the community through donations and volunteers. You can help these deserving animals for under 80 cents a day ($25 a month) you can provide the food and medical care needed for a long-term resident of your choice. If you are interested in sponsoring any of these amazing animals, choose sponsor a pet/kennel to the right to leave a $25 recurring donation and leave a comment in regards to your choice of sponsorship!

    You can also sponsor a building or project. We have a huge campus that needs consistent or seasonal care. For example, the Dog Building is a long-time project that CVAS is allocating funds to winterize and improve for the dogs that come through CVAS. It currently features 8 kennels, a puppy play pad, and we are looking to finish construction on dog play areas. In addition to the dog kennel building, we have four buildings/kennel areas that house our kittens and cats. These buildings need constant cleaning and care from our staff and volunteers. Special projects are ongoing on a constant basis as needed and include landscaping needs, safety improvements, and general seasonal maintenance. If you are interested in sponsoring a building or a project, we would be happy to schedule a tour so that we can answer any of your questions. Give us a call if you would like a tour or choose to sponsor a building/project to the right to get started for $50 a month.
