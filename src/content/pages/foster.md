    Fostering a cat or dog can be a rewarding experience for the loving and gracious families who participate in the program with CVAS. To become a part of the program, please fill out the application found below. We have a need for cat fosters and dog foster, so please select the form for either cat or dog, or fill out both forms if you are interested in fostering both cats and dogs.

    CVAS foster parents help all kinds of animals, from tiny kittens that need bottle feeding to senior dogs in need of a quiet place to rest. Some animals just need a safe space to recover from tough times, such as recent surgery, or a rough life on the streets. If you have a little free time and some empty space, please consider becoming a foster parent, and come to the rescue of an animal in need.
