      Hi, I’m McKenzie! I grew up on the west side of Washington and spent some time in the Navy before settling in Colville with my family about four years ago. When I arrived, I noticed the area's overpopulation of feral and stray cats and knew I had to help.

      I’ve been volunteering at the sanctuary for about 2.5 years, and you’ll often find me at vaccination clinics,  spay/neuter clinics, or assisting the Animal Care Team. I’ve also had the chance to work with adopters, helping them find their newest family members.

      My goal is to give every animal that comes through the sanctuary all the love and compassion they deserve—whether they’re here for a vaccine or a looking for their forever home, they’ll leave with as much love as I can give them!

      Noah Nequette has been volunteering with CVAS since 2023 and fostering since 2024. Noah is a Forester with Washington Dept of Natural Resources, and has been living and working in Colville since 2019 when he and his wife Sara moved from the west side. With (currently) 2 dogs and 5 cats of their own, Noah and Sara both have always been the "I found this poor sweet animal somewhere and need help with what to do with it" go-to people of their groups, and love being part of the CVAS community.

      Katherine has been fostering cats and kittens for CVAS since 2019.  She and her family have fostered over 100 cats and kittens in the past six years.  Wanting to be more involved with the running of the shelter, Katherine started volunteering in the CVAS office in 2023.  She answers the phone helping to give people information on low cost spay/neuter clinics, vaccine clinics, and take down information about animals who need to be surrendered to the shelter.  She has also recently started training as an adoption specialist, she loves helping adopters find the purrfect addition to their family!

      Amber has spent nearly a decade in the insurance industry, where she’s known for her down-to earth approach and genuine care for her clients. Her career journey started in customer service— waitressing, bartending, and tax preparation—experiences that taught her the importance of listening, building trust, and helping people feel at ease. Today, she’s proud to have played a big role in growing a successful Nevada-based insurance brokerage, built largely on referrals from clients who value her honesty and dedication. 

      When she’s not working, life is loud, fun, and a little chaotic—in the best way. Amber is a proud mom of two teenage boys, has been happily married to her amazing husband for over 15 years, and their five dogs definitely keep the family on their toes (and spoiled!). She loves balancing work, family, laughter, and a little chaos—it keeps life interesting!
