    bio: >
      Hi, I’m McKenzie! I grew up on the west side of Washington and spent some
      time in the Navy before settling in Colville with my family about four
      years ago. When I arrived, I noticed the area's overpopulation of feral
      and stray cats and knew I had to help.


      I’ve been volunteering at the sanctuary for about 2.5 years, and you’ll
      often find me at vaccination clinics,  spay/neuter clinics, or assisting
      the Animal Care Team. I’ve also had the chance to work with adopters,
      helping them find their newest family members.


      My goal is to give every animal that comes through the sanctuary all the
      love and compassion they deserve—whether they’re here for a vaccine or a
      looking for their forever home, they’ll leave with as much love as I can
      give them!

      since 2024. Noah is a Forester with Washington Dept of Natural Resources,
      and has been living and working in Colville since 2019 when he and his
      wife Sara moved from the west side. With (currently) 2 dogs and 5 cats of
      their own, Noah and Sara both have always been the "I found this poor
      sweet animal somewhere and need help with what to do with it" go-to people
      of their groups, and love being part of the CVAS community.

      and her family have fostered over 100 cats and kittens in the past six
      years.  Wanting to be more involved with the running of the shelter,
      Katherine started volunteering in the CVAS office in 2023.  She answers
      the phone helping to give people information on low cost spay/neuter
      clinics, vaccine clinics, and take down information about animals who need
      to be surrendered to the shelter.  She has also recently started training
      as an adoption specialist, she loves helping adopters find the purrfect
      addition to their family!

    bio: >
      Amber has spent nearly a decade in the insurance industry, where she’s
      known for her down-to earth approach and genuine care for her clients. Her
      career journey started in customer service— waitressing, bartending, and
      tax preparation—experiences that taught her the importance of listening,
      building trust, and helping people feel at ease. Today, she’s proud to
      have played a big role in growing a successful Nevada-based insurance
      brokerage, built largely on referrals from clients who value her honesty
      and dedication. 


      When she’s not working, life is loud, fun, and a little chaotic—in the
      best way. Amber is a proud mom of two teenage boys, has been happily
      married to her amazing husband for over 15 years, and their five dogs
      definitely keep the family on their toes (and spoiled!). She loves
      balancing work, family, laughter, and a little chaos—it keeps life
      interesting!

      of animals and their shared world with humans. As a registered member of

      adoptions of cats and dogs from the Colville area and has been a devoted
      follower of CVAS for several years. She nominated CVAS for the Washington
      State Employee Combined Fund Drive – a service to assist state employees

      will do volunteer work when possible, offering civil engineering advice
      for CVAS projects and general labor assistance.

    bio: My name is Julie Ogle. With a background in medical transcription, I’ve
      developed a strong attention to detail and a deep sense of
      compassion—qualities that extend into my lifelong love for animals. Over
      the years, I’ve rescued numerous cats and dogs, offering them safety,
      care, and a second chance at life. My passion lies in helping homeless
      pets find loving, permanent homes where they can thrive in healthy, stable
      environments. Every rescue is a step closer to my goal of making the world
      a kinder place for animals in need. CVAS offers me a chance to help and
      make a difference.
