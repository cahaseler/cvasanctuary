    If you are a senior (50+) and looking for your furry best friendâ€”your search is over! Our Seniors Saving Seniors program matches seniors in Stevens County with our senior pets for no adoption fee. Senior pets are harder to adopt out due to their age and projected complications, but they deserve a loving home. We want our senior community members to benefit from the love of these amazing animals!
