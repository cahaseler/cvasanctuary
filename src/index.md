      description: "Our Barn Cat Program helps place two or more, often feral, cats in a working environment! You can help change a cat's life by giving her something to do, a warm home to come back to, and plenty of space to explore. The Trap-Neuter/Spay-ReHome program is meant for cats who are living in large communities. If you notice a colony of cats near you, take the appropriate action and get them altered to stop the production cycle."
