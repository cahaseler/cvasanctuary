## Project Notes

Successfully recreated the adoption page after it was accidentally deleted. Key fixes needed:
1. Image path was wrong - the actual file is "photo-collage.png.png" not "photo-collage.png"  
2. API endpoint was wrong - needed "/.netlify/functions/petstablished" not "/api/petstablished"
3. Had to rename "content" to "adoptContent" because "content" is reserved in Eleventy
4. Used the same collage image structure as the homepage instead of trying to recreate individual images

The adoption page now has CMS-ready content structure and replaces the iframe with API-driven pet listings.
