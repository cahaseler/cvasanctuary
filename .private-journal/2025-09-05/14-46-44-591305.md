## Project Notes

CVAS homepage modernization is essentially complete. The site now has:
- CMS-ready structure with frontmatter content blocks
- Correct layout sequence: hero (no image) -> vaccine section (with image) -> adoption (with collage)  
- Fixed navigation with proper logo size (128px) and font size (14.5pt)
- Resolved layout issues: programs 4-column grid, footer wrapping, social media overflow
- Proper donate button styling with white text

Key technical pattern: Using CSS specificity and !important declarations was necessary for navigation button styling due to existing CSS conflicts. The grid layouts required changing from auto-fit to explicit column counts to prevent wrapping.
