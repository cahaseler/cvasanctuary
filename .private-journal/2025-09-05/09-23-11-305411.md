## Project Notes

Craig reminded me about two important points:
1. Use TDD for testable components - any JavaScript we write for filtering, API calls, etc should have tests written first
2. Match the actual current site's styling - I should fetch and analyze the real site rather than guessing at colors and styles

This is a good catch - I was making assumptions about the green colors when I should be looking at the actual site.
