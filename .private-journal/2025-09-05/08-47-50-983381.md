## Project Notes

For the CVAS project:
- The iframe URL probably looks like: https://petstablished.com/widgets/shelter/2928982 or similar
- That widget page makes client-side calls to the same API endpoints we discovered
- We can replicate (and improve upon) all iframe functionality
- Key advantage: We control caching, which the iframe doesn't allow
- Can implement progressive enhancement - show cached data immediately, update when fresh data arrives
