Understood. I will go to cvasanctuary.org and carefully review each page to document its content, design, and layout in detail. I'll begin this now and let you know what I find.


Here is a detailed inventory of every page on **cvasanctuary.org** as of September 5 2025, including the key text, images, forms and layout you will need to replicate when rebuilding the site.  I grouped pages by navigation area and listed major sections in the order they appear on screen.

---

## Home (landing page)

* **Hero/mission section** – Large heading encourages visitors to join CVAS’s mission with a sub‑heading “Help Animals in Need Through Your Support.”  A prominent **green “Donate to Help Us Help Them!” button** sits above the heading.

## About CVAS dropdown

### Mission & Vision (`/about-cvas`)

* Introduced as “Mission & Vision.”  Text explains that CVAS is an animal shelter in rural Stevens County, Washington whose mission is to **inspire humane treatment of animals**.  Bullet‑style vision statements describe goals such as local government support for animal issues, community education on humane treatment, rare animal abuse/neglect cases, and reducing homeless feral animals.
* Additional paragraphs provide history: CVAS began in 2002 as the **Colville Pet Refuge**, offers humane society services (shelter/rescue, spay/neuter, adoption, affordable routine care), and must cover thousands of square miles because there is no municipal shelter in Stevens County.  It emphasizes that the organization is run by volunteers and donor funding.

### Impact (`/cvas-impact`)
