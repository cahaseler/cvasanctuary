kitten days, I was known as Jolly Silver!&nbsp; I loved to play with tennis balls, strings dangled by my human, or any small object.&nbsp; I was always trying to engage a sibling in play of various sorts.&nbsp; When the second set of kittens arrived on the Patio, I became the &quot;father&quot; or protector of the four little ones (there were four or five males strays that tried to come around, and when I screamed and my human waould come chase them away, or I would take them on and fight them).&nbsp; The day I was put in a cage and taken to the Clinic for neutering became the worst day of my life.&nbsp; My playfulness disappeared and life became more serious.&nbsp; I like to hunt voles and will sit over their holes until I can catch one.&nbsp; At first, I liked to climb the wooden privacy fence, but one day I fell off and my left hind leg bothered me for a week.&nbsp; Eventually, it healed, but I decided climbing was not for me.&nbsp; My &quot;territory&quot; includes the property across the alley, and the empty lot adjacent to our home.&nbsp; I am talkative and love to accompany my owner when she goes aross the alley for a visit with neighbors, then I will accompany her back home.&nbsp; I know my name and will come when my owner calls.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I eat 1/2 cup of dry&nbsp;food a
